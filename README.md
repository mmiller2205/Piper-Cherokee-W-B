# Piper-Cherokee-W-B

The Piper Cherokee PA-28-180 aircraft's weight and balance are determined by my MATLAB algorithm. It computes the total ramp weight, gathers inputs for different weights, and verifies that it is within the permitted range. After that, the script calculates the moments for the various airplane components and establishes the center of gravity. Last but not least, it determines whether the center of gravity is within the safe range for flying and lets the user trial different settings or exit out.
